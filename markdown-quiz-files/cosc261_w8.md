# COSC261 Quiz: Foundations of Logic and Formal Languages

50. For the grammar S → aSb | SS | ε, which strings can be generated?
   - [x] ε (empty string)
   - [x] ab
   - [x] aabb
   - [x] abab

51. A context-free grammar in Greibach Normal Form has all productions of the form:
   - ( ) A → a
   - ( ) A → BC
   - (x) A → aα where a is terminal and α is a string of non-terminals
   - ( ) A → αBβ

52. The complement of a context-free language is always context-free.
   - ( ) True
   - (x) False

53. Which of the following problems are decidable?
   - [x] Whether a DFA accepts the empty language
   - [x] Whether two DFAs accept the same language
   - [ ] Whether a context-free grammar is ambiguous
   - [x] Whether a regular expression matches a given string

54. The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP) is:
   - ( ) Decidable for all instances
   - (x) Undecidable in general
   - ( ) Only defined for binary alphabets
   - ( ) Equivalent to the Halting Problem

55. Two context-free grammars are equivalent if they generate the same language.
   - (x) True
   - ( ) False

56. When converting an NFA with ε-transitions to a DFA, the ε-closure of a state includes:
   - [x] The state itself
   - [x] All states reachable via ε-transitions
   - [x] States reachable through chains of ε-transitions
   - [ ] Only directly connected ε-transition states
