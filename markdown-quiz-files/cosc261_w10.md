65. What is the name of the property that allows us to say "if a problem A reduces to problem B and B is decidable, then A is decidable"?
   - R:= Reducibility

66. Name the type of reduction commonly used to prove undecidability results.
   - R:= Many-one reduction

67. What is the technical term for a Turing machine that can simulate any other Turing machine?
   - R:= Universal Turing Machine

68. In parsing theory, what does "shift-reduce conflict" indicate?
   - R:= Grammar ambiguity in LR parsing
