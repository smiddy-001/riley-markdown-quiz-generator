# COSC261 Quiz: Foundations of Logic and Formal Languages

29. Which grammar type allows productions of the form αAβ → αγβ where α, β, γ are strings and A is a non-terminal?
   - ( ) Regular grammar
   - (x) Context-sensitive grammar
   - ( ) Context-free grammar
   - ( ) Unrestricted grammar

30. In the Chomsky hierarchy, which inclusion relationship is correct?
   - ( ) Regular ⊃ Context-Free ⊃ Context-Sensitive ⊃ Recursively Enumerable
   - (x) Regular ⊂ Context-Free ⊂ Context-Sensitive ⊂ Recursively Enumerable
   - ( ) All language classes are equal
   - ( ) Context-Free ⊂ Regular ⊂ Context-Sensitive

31. The CYK algorithm is used for:
   - ( ) Converting NFAs to DFAs
   - ( ) Minimizing DFAs
   - (x) Parsing with context-free grammars in Chomsky Normal Form
   - ( ) Deciding if a language is regular

32. LL(1) parsing is:
   - [x] A top-down parsing method
   - [x] Requires one symbol of lookahead
   - [ ] More powerful than LR(1) parsing
   - [x] Cannot handle left-recursive grammars

33. An LR(1) grammar can handle left recursion while an LL(1) grammar cannot.
   - (x) True
   - ( ) False

34. What is the name of the construction method used to convert a regular expression to an NFA?
   - R:= Thompson's Construction

35. What is the name of the lemma used to prove that certain languages are not context-free?
   - R:= Pumping Lemma for Context-Free Languages
