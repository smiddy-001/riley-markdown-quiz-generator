43. Rice's Theorem states that:
   - ( ) All languages are decidable
   - (x) Any non-trivial property of recursively enumerable languages is undecidable

46. What is the minimum number of tape symbols needed for a universal Turing machine (including blank)?
   - R:= 2

47. In formal language theory, what does Îµ represent?
   - R:= Empty String

48. What is the name of the algorithm used to minimize a DFA by identifying equivalent states?
   - R:= Table Filling Algorithm

49. Which of the following strings are in the language generated by the regular expression (a|b)*abb?
