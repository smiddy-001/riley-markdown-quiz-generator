# COSC261 Quiz: Foundations of Logic and Formal Languages

1. A tautology is a compound proposition that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its component propositions.
    - (x) True
    - ( ) False

2. Which of the following correctly represents DeMorgan's Law for propositional logic?
    - (x) ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p) ∨ (¬q)
    - ( ) ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ (¬p) ∧ (¬q)
    - ( ) ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ (¬p) ∧ (¬q) only
    - ( ) ¬(p → q) ≡ p ∧ ¬q

3. In a proof by contradiction for showing √2 is irrational, what do we assume at the start?
    - ( ) √2 is irrational
    - (x) √2 is rational
    - ( ) √2 = p/q where p and q are odd
    - ( ) √2 is a natural number

4. Which of the following statements about Russell's Paradox are correct?
    - [x] It shows there is no set of all sets
    - [x] It derives a contradiction from naive set theory
    - [ ] It proves that all sets are finite
    - [ ] It only applies to empty sets

5. If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ⊆ P(B), where P denotes the power set.
    - (x) True
    - ( ) False

6. Using Boolean algebra laws, A ∪ (A ∩ B) simplifies to:
    - ( ) A ∩ B
