# COSC261 Quiz: Foundations of Logic and Formal Languages

72. Consider the language L = {w#w | w ∈ {a,b}*}. This language is:
   - ( ) Regular
   - ( ) Context-free
   - (x) Context-sensitive
   - ( ) Not recursively enumerable

73. The intersection of two context-free languages is:
   - ( ) Always context-free
   - (x) Not necessarily context-free
   - ( ) Always regular
   - ( ) Always context-sensitive

74. A linear bounded automaton is a Turing machine where:
   - ( ) The tape is infinite in both directions
   - (x) The tape is bounded by the input length
   - ( ) Multiple tapes are used
   - ( ) The machine is deterministic

75. What is the name of the famous conjecture that P ≠ NP?
   - R:= P versus NP problem

76. In automata theory, what does the term "acceptance by final state" mean for a PDA?
   - R:= String accepted when PDA reaches final state regardless of stack

77. What is the name of the algorithm that determines if a context-free grammar generates any strings?
   - R:= Emptiness Algorithm

78. Name the property that states context-free languages are closed under union and concatenation but not intersection.
   - R:= Partial closure properties

79. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color any planar graph (this connects to computational complexity)?
   - R:= 4

80. In the context of formal language theory, what does "generative capacity" refer to?
   - R:= The set of languages a grammar type can generate
