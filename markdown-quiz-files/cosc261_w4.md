# COSC261 Quiz: Foundations of Logic and Formal Languages

22. Which of the following languages can be recognized by a PDA but not by a DFA?
   - [x] {a^n b^n | n ≥ 0}
   - [x] {ww^R | w ∈ {a,b}*}
   - [ ] {a^n | n is even}
   - [x] {a^i b^j c^k | i = j or j = k}

23. The language {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 0} is context-free.
   - ( ) True
   - (x) False

24. A deterministic PDA is equivalent in power to a non-deterministic PDA.
   - ( ) True
   - (x) False

25. A Turing machine consists of which components?
   - [x] A finite state control
   - [x] An infinite tape
   - [x] A read/write head
   - [ ] A stack

26. The Church-Turing thesis states that:
   - ( ) All problems are computable
   - (x) Any effectively computable function can be computed by a Turing machine
   - ( ) Turing machines are faster than other computation models
   - ( ) All languages are decidable

27. Which of the following problems is undecidable?
   - ( ) Whether a DFA accepts a given string
   - ( ) Whether two DFAs are equivalent
   - (x) Whether a Turing machine halts on a given input
   - ( ) Whether a context-free grammar is ambiguous

28. A language is recursively enumerable if:
   - ( ) It can be decided by a Turing machine that always halts
   - (x) It can be accepted by a Turing machine (may not halt on rejection)
   - ( ) It is finite
   - ( ) It is context-free
